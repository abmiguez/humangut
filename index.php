				The human gut microbiome impacts several aspects of human health and disease, including digestion, drug metabolism, and the propensity to develop various inflammatory, autoimmune and metabolic diseases.<br/>

				Many of the molecular processes that play a role in the activity and dynamics of the microbiota go beyond species and genic composition of the that are commonly measured in the microbiome and thus, 
				their understanding requires advanced bioinformatics support. <br/>
				This webpage aims to provide an up-to-date view of the resources and software tools that are being developed and used in human gut microbiome research, in particular data integration and systems-level 
				analysis efforts. </p>
